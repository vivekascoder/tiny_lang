## Expressions

What are expressions?

1. Literals (Bool, Numbers, etc),
2. Identifiers (Varibles),
3. Function calls,
4. Infix, Prefix (++3, !4, 4- 3)

What should the `eval_expr(e: Expr)` return?

1. Literals -> Literal.
2. Idenfiers
   1. Variables -> Literal
3. Function calls -> The return type of the function.
   1. Return type is void -> Void,
   2. Return type is literal -> Literal,
   3. Return type is, ... for now nothing else is supported.
4. Infix, Prefix -> Literal

What should `eval_infix_expr(e: InfixExpr)` do?

1. Left expr is literal
2. Anything else -> parse expression again

What should my environment store?

1. Variables
   - Name, Value
2. Functions
   - Name, parameter, body
3. Structs
   - field name, field value

How does function looks like in tiny_lang?

```ts
fun calculate_something(a: usize, b: usize) => bool {
    if (a > b) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

What can be inside a function / statement types.

1. let, declare a variable.
2. assign or mutate a variable.
3. If, else.
4. return statement.

Will we require nested scopes in interpreter?

```
{
    scope: {
        "something": 23,
        "another": 34,
    },
    parent: {
        scope: {
            "something": 23,
            "another": 34,
        },
        parent: null,
    }
}
```

How to store functions?

- Can expressions result in a function?
  - false
- What type is getting stored in the memory?

How tihe recursive `ExprResult::Return<Box<ExprResult>>` should be handled?

For syntax highlighting

Parse isize or usize based on type.

### Compiler

1. If let is `usize` and val is `isize`

Not going to implement a compiler that compile to some IR and a VM that evaluates this IR until I can some interesting reference impls.

## Things that are remaining.

## Parts

- Lexer
- Parser
- Interpreter
- IR
- VM
- Codegen using LLVM/cranelift/binaryen

## Possible routes to take moving forward.

1. Writing a interpreter based VM.
2. LLVM
3. Cranelift
4. ‚ùå Wasm
   It'll require a lot of work as WASM has pretty simple data types, being able to map complex datatypes into WASM vec.

  This toy lang generates the WASM bytecode in the parser from scratch based on the parsed Node.
  They use some sort of macro to generate bytecode on the fly.
